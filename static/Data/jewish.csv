Slicing the brisket half-way through cooking assures that the meat is tender and flavorful. Perfect for Passover or Easter dinner.I made this recipe Passover friendly using ground matzo in place of flour. I simply took a matzo I had from my matzo pizza and ground it in the food processor or you could also use cake meal which they sell in the Kosher section of your supermarket. If you are not celebrating Passover you could use all purpose flour instead. For gluten free, rice flour works fine.

Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large 7-quart Dutch oven or other heavy pot with a lid large enough to hold the brisket. Add the brisket to the pot and brown on both sides, about 10-12 minutes.Remove meat and set aside. Add the onions, salt and pepper to the pot and cook until soft and browned, about 10-12 minutes stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.Return the brisket and any accumulated juices to the pot on top of the onions. Spread the tomato paste over the brisket, sprinkle with salt and more pepper to taste, then add the garlic, beef broth and carrots to the pot. Cover the pot, transfer to the oven, and cook the brisket for about 1-1/2 hours.Remove the brisket and transfer to a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, slice the meat across the grain into approximately 1/8-inch-thick slices. Return the slices back to the pot, keeping the brisket together so it resembles the unsliced brisket.Add potatoes and sprinkle with a little more salt and pepper.Cover the pot and return to the oven. Reduce heat to 325F and cook the brisket until it is fork-tender and the potatoes are cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours. Check once or twice during cooking to add more broth if needed.To serve you can arrange the meat on a platter with the carrots, onions, potatoes and some of the liquid and garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Have ready a large ovenproof enameled cast-iron pot or other heavy pot that has a lid and is large enough to just barely contain the brisket snugly.2. Lightly dust the brisket with flour, then sprinkle it with pepper. Heat the oil in the pot over medium-high heat. Add the brisket to the pot and cook on both sides until crusty and browned areas appear on the surface here and there, 5 to 7 minutes per side.3. Transfer the brisket to a platter. Turn up the heat under the pot a bit, then add the onions and cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Cook until the onions have softened and developed a rich brown color but aren’t yet caramelized, 10 to 15 minutes.4. Turn off the heat and place the brisket on top of the onions. Pour any juices that accumulated on the platter over the brisket. Spread the tomato paste over the brisket as if you were icing a cake. Sprinkle the brisket with salt and pepper, then add the garlic and carrot to the pot. Cover the pot, transfer it to the oven, and let it cook, untouched, for 1 1/2 hours.5. Transfer the brisket to a cutting board. Using a very sharp knife, thinly slice the meat across the grain into approximately 1/8-inch-thick slices. Return the slices to the pot, overlapping them at an angle so that you can see a bit of the top edge of each slice. The end result should resemble the original unsliced brisket leaning slightly backward. If absolutely necessary, add 2 to 3 teaspoons of water to the pot.6. Cover the pot and return it to the oven. Lower the heat to 325°F (163°C) and cook until the brisket is fork-tender, about 2 hours more. Check once or twice during cooking to make sure that the liquid hasn’t bubbled away. If it has, add a few more teaspoons of water—but no more. Also, each time you check, spoon some of the liquid on top of the roast so that it drips down between the slices.7. It’s ready to serve right away with its juices, but, in fact, it’s even better the second day. (You can let the brisket cool, cover it loosely with foil, and refrigerate it overnight to serve the day after. Skim any fat from the surface of the liquid and reheat the brisket, covered, in an oven turned to 325°F (163°C)  for about an hour.)","You can never have too many main course recipes, so give Nach Waxman’s Brisket a try.
