Greek Salmon Souvlaki Gyros with Tzatziki,greek,"InstructionsTo prepare the tzatziki sauce pour any liquid off the surface of the greek yogurt. (I find it is best to use full fat greek yogurt for this, but 2% works ok as well. You want the yogurt to be thick, so if your greek yogurt seems thin strain it through a fine mesh strainer). Mix together the greek yogurt, diced cucumber, garlic, white wine vinegar, dill, oregano, salt and pepper to taste, and lemon juice. Drizzle with olive oil. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.In a medium sized bowl combine the lemon juice, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprikia, dill, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the salmon and toss well, making sure the salmon is completely coated in the seasonings.Heat your grill to medium high heat.Alternate threading the salmon and the red pepper chunks on the skewers. I used two long skewers, but whatever size you have will work fine. Using a pair of tongs, carefully transfer the salmon skewers to the preheated grill and grill for about 3 minutes on each side or until the salmon is cooked to your desired doneness. Remove the salmon skewers from the grill and let rest for about 5 minutes to let the salmon just continue to cook.While the salmon rest make the tapenade, dice the olives and mix in a small bowl with the garlic, pepperoncini and parsley.To assemble the pitas, heat pitas (I just place them directly on the stove for 20 seconds on each side or in the microwave for 20 seconds). Spread a layer of tzatziki down the middle of each pita, top with 4 or 5 salmon and red pepper chunks. Add the tapenade, tomatoes and finish with a generous amount of feta cheese."

Surround with the vegetables and pears.Remove the herb bundle from the sauce. The book suggests thickening the sauce into gravy by ricing one of the potatoes and adding it to the cooking liquid. I tried this, but it was still a bit on the thin side, so instead I added 1 tbsp of corn starch mixed with a little cold water (corn starch wasn't commonly used as a thickener till after this cookbook was published, so this was a slight modernization). I simmered it in the remaining sauce till it thickened into a nice gravy. You can add more cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it further, if desired. Season with salt and pepper to taste (I used lots of pepper!).Serve the stew with hot gravy to pour over each serving. Serve."

Whisk to combine.Add the salmon to a medium size bowl or gallon size ziplock bag and rub with about 1/4 cup of the sauce. Reserve the remaining sauce for later.When the grill is hot, add the salmon, flesh side down (this is also when I grilled the pineapple for the salsa). Grill about 3-4 minutes and then flip, baste with a little of the jerk sauce and grill about another two to three minutes. Remove the salmon from the grill, allow to cool a few minutes and then remove the skin from the salmon and cut into four equal pieces.While the salmon cools make the salsa. Grill or broil the pineapple until charred (again, I did this while grilling the salmon). Allow to cool and chop into chunks. In a medium size bowl toss the grilled pineapple, chopped peach, tomatoes, jalapeo, toasted coconut, cilantro, lime juice and salt. Toss well and taste. Add more salt if needed.Toss the coconut rice with the black beans.Preheat the broiler to high.Divide the rice among the 4 tostadas and top with equal amounts of cheddar cheese. Place under the broiler for 30 seconds or until the cheese is melted, watch closely. Remove from the oven and top each tostada with a piece of salmon and then top with the pineapple peach salsa. Serve."

Sweet Potato and Millet Falafel,middle eastern,"Place the chickpeas, sweet potato, onion, garlic, parsley, cilantro, coriander, salt, cumin, cayenne, and black pepper into the bowl of a food processor and alternate between pulsing and blending, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally, until all of the ingredients in the the falafel mixture are uniform in size, but still slightly grainy in texture. Transfer the mixture to a mixing bowl and fold in the cooked millet. Roll a small amount of the falafel mixture into a walnut sized ball or a small patty with your hands. It should hold together nicely and not fall apart. (If it seems too wet, sprinkle the mixture with a small amount of the chickpea flour, no more than a tablespoon at a time, and fold it in. Once texture is correct, sprinkle the baking soda over the falafel and stir the mixture until combined.) Repeat the shaping process with the rest of the falafel mixture and place the uncooked falafel on a large plate or baking sheet until ready to cook.Pour the grapeseed oil into a high-sided skillet or saucepan to a depth of 3 inches or high enough to cover the falafel. Place a thermometer into the oil and heat on medium-high until the temperature reaches 360°-375°F.While the oil is heating, place a flattened paper grocery bag onto a baking sheet and cover it with a few clean paper towels. This will help to collect the oil as it drains off of your falafel.When the oil is ready, fry a test falafel. The oil should bubble up and sizzle all around it. The falafel itself should stay together in one piece and not break apart at all. It should take 2-3 minutes to fry to a beautiful golden brown. If your falafel is not completely submerged flip and cook the other side until it’s nice and browned all over. Remove the cooked falafel from the oil and drain on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with coarse salt while the falafel is still hot, if desired. Fry the remaining falafel in batches, being careful not to over-crowd the pan and drop the temperature of the oil.Shape your falafel into patties, not balls. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Pour 2-3 tablespoons of grape seed oil in the skillet and swirl to coat. Place the falafel patties in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side, until crispy and browned. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to absorb the excess oil and sprinkle with coarse salt, if desired.Shape your falafel into patties, not balls. Preheat the oven to 400ºF and spray a baking sheet with an oil mister filled with grapeseed oil. Place the falafel onto the baking sheet and spray the tops with additional oil; bake for about 25 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking time, or until golden brown on the outside."

The Best Falafel,middle eastern,"To soak dried chickpeas, rinse them and then put them in a large bowl.  Cover with lots of cold water and soak for 12 hours, or overnight.

Scrape down the sides of the machine, and process until the mixture is even and finely ground, but not pasty.

Make sure it is well combined, but don't compact the mixture.Heat your oil to 340- 350F, using a clip on thermometer to check the temperature.  Your oil should be at least 3 inches deep.
