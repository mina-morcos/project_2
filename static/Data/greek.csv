Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld.In a medium sized bowl combine the lemon juice, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, smoked paprikia, dill, oregano, garlic, salt and pepper. Add the salmon and toss well, making sure the salmon is completely coated in the seasonings.Heat your grill to medium high heat.Alternate threading the salmon and the red pepper chunks on the skewers. I used two long skewers, but whatever size you have will work fine. Using a pair of tongs, carefully transfer the salmon skewers to the preheated grill and grill for about 3 minutes on each side or until the salmon is cooked to your desired doneness. Remove the salmon skewers from the grill and let rest for about 5 minutes to let the salmon just continue to cook.While the salmon rest make the tapenade, dice the olives and mix in a small bowl with the garlic, pepperoncini and parsley.To assemble the pitas, heat pitas (I just place them directly on the stove for 20 seconds on each side or in the microwave for 20 seconds).
