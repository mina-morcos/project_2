551477,Pork Roulade with Candied Butternut Squash & Ginger Chutney,https://spoonacular.com/recipeImages/551477-312x231.jpg,german,10,45,http://thehealthyfoodie.com/2013/11/19/pork-roulade-with-candied-butternut-squash-and-ginger-chutney/,355.76,87.0,236,False,False,True,True,8,"In a heavy skillet set over medium high heat melt a little bit of cooking fat (lard, ghee or coconut oil preferred). When fat is nice and hot, add onions, ginger, butternut squash and salt; cook over medium heat for 4-5 minutesAdd the rest of the ingredients and simmer over low heat, stirring from time to time, until liquid is completely gone and chutney has a candied look, about 30 - 35 minutes.Let the mixture cool while you prepare your pork loin for stuffing.  First, make a horizontal incision through the entire length of the top third of the loin, from right to left, but without allowing the blade to go all the way through. The roast needs to stay in one piece. Then, flip the roast around and repeat the exact same process, so that your roast ends up being sliced in each third, once from left to right and once from right to left, as shown below. You should now be able to unfold your roast into a flat slab of meat, although you might have to pound it lightly and cut a little bit more here and there to get it to lay real flat. Lay your roast fat side down on a cutting board and spread the reserved chutney over the entire surface of the meat, except for a few inches on the side where the layer of fat is located. This is where your roulade will close up. Roll tightly and tie with butcher’s twine. Carefully place the roast in a Dutch oven, sprinkle with more salt and pepper and drizzle with maple syrupAdd sweet apple cider and water at bottom of the pan.  Cover and roast in a 350F oven for 2½ hours, basting 2 or 3 times. If necessary, you might want to uncover the roast for the last 10 to 15 minutes of cooking time to ensure that the top gets nice and golden. Remove from oven and allow the roast to rest for about 15-20 minutes before carving. Serve with remaining chutney.","Pork Roulade with Candied Butternut Squash & Ginger Chutney might be just the main course you are searching for.

Season both sides with salt and pepper. Dividing mustard evenly between each steak, spread on the surface of one side of meat.                                                                                                                            2                                                                            Place bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat and cook until fat has started to render and bacon is lightly browned, about 4 minutes, flipping once. Lay one slice of lightly browned bacon on each piece of slathered steak, followed by an onion, carrot spear, and pickle spear. Trim vegetables to fit the length of each steak. Starting at the short end, roll the meat up like a jellyroll and secure with kitchen twine.                                                                                                                             3                                                                            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is shimmering, add beef and cook until well browned on all sides, about 6 minutes total. Reduce heat to medium and add garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add broth and wine and scrape any browned bits off of bottom with wooden spoon. Bring liquid to a boil, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook until meat is tender, about 1 1/2 hours.                                                                                                                            4                                                                            Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Mix 1 cup flour, egg, milk, dill, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper in a medium bowl.                                                                                                                             5                                                                            Working in batches while using a sturdy spoon, force spaetzle through holes of a spaetzle maker or large-holed colander into the boiling water. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until noodles float to the surface. Drain well into a colander, and quickly shock spaetzle with cold water.                                                                                                                              6                                                                            When beef is cooked, heat butter and remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until foaming subsides. Add spaetzle, shake once to distribute evenly, and cook without moving until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and transfer to a serving platter and keep warm.                                                                                                                            7                                                                            Remove meat from pan, discard twine and keep warm. Combine remaining 1/3 cup flour and 3/4 cup water, whisking until smooth and lump-free. Slowly stir into broth. Whisking constantly, bring to a boil, and simmer until gravy is thickened and starchiness of flour has disappeared. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour gravy into a gravy boat, straining through a fine-mesh strainer, if necessary. Transfer beef to serving platter. Serve beef and spaetzle with gravy on the side.","The recipe Beef Rouladen With Dill Spaetzle could satisfy your European craving in roughly <b>1 hour and 45 minutes</b>.
