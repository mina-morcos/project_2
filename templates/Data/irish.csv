Comfort food without the guilt!This is a crazy month for the North East. First we got slammed with a hurricane, and yesterday a Nor'easter. This is what it looks like outside my door...Thousands of people, including myself are still without power. Here on the south shore of Long Island, the fear the power company has is if they turn the power back on, it may start fires to the homes with severe water damage. There of talks of having to inspect every home before they turn the power back on... I'm afraid this means it could be a while before I get my power back.I'm not complaining, I'm managing fine for now thanks to my generator to keep my house warm, but many neighbors aren't so lucky. Yesterday I visited an elderly woman who lives by herself, was cold, had no food and it just broke my heart knowing she is one of many. My girlfriend and I went grocery shopping for her and brought her some food and batteries and a warm hug, but she insisted on staying home despite the cold.Talk about a month to give thanks, I just want to remind you all to count your blessings!

Saute onions, parsnips, carrots and 1/2 tsp salt for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally until onions are golden and carrots are tender. Turn heat down to medium. Add mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes, garlic, herbs and 1/2 tsp salt and continue to sauté on medium heat, stirring frequently, until mushrooms begin to give off their liquid, about another 8 minutes. Still on med heat, add 1 C red wine. Stir occasionally, and let wine reduce until its almost gone, about another 8 minutes.At this point you could divide your stew mixture ( if you want to add lamb of beef to part of it) For example, I like my shepherds pie, without meat. My husband likes his with meat, so I separate a portion, adding cooked lamb to his portion. When having guests over, you could do half and half if you like.While wine is reducing, heat 3 C vegetable stock and add 1 T miso, in a separate pot, stirring until its dissolved.When wine is mostly reduced, Sprinkle with 2 T rice flour ( or regular flour) and stir it for about 2 minutes. Add hot stock/miso mixture to the pot, stirring until the stew thickens, about 3 minutes. Taste for salt, add more cracked pepper if necessary, and 1/2 tsp balsamic vinegar. Remove from heat, stir in fresh Italian parsley.Pour your stew into a baking dish, an oven proof skillet or individual baking dishes, or ramekins. For a little extra luxury drizzle the top of the stew with a few drops of truffle oil.Potato topping: There are two options here, read both and decide which one you want to do.Option 1: Make truffled mashed potatoes....the slower, but better wayPeel and dice 4 lbs of yukon gold potatoes, into 1 inch pieces. Make sure the pieces are similar in size. Place in a sauté pan, cover with an inch of water with 2 tsp kosher salt and 4 minced garlic cloves. Boil until very tender about 15-20 minutes. Drain, mash with potato masher and add 2 T olive oil and 1 T truffle oil. Taste for salt. I like adding just a little white pepper. Put in a piping bag and pipe out over stew. If potatoes seem too dry to pipe, add a little hot water to them and  they will loosen up nicely.Place Completed pies in a preheated 375F oven and bake until bubbly and golden, about 20 minutes. Serve with a sprig of thyme and a good red wine.Option 2: Sliced Yukons, the fast way ( but longer baking time) Slice 4 round yukon gold potatoes very thinly using a mandolin or very sharp knife. Remember, as thinly as possible, the thinner the better. Blot dry. Toss with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.For a little extra luxury, drizzle the top of the stew with a few drops of truffle oil. Arrange potatoes in overlapping concentric circles, over the stew. Sprinkle with a little thyme or rosemary. Bake in a 400 F Oven for 40-45 minutes minutes until potatoes are golden and crispy.
